# Elementary Level Circuit Simulator
 To solve or analyze a linear circuit in MATLAB one has to derive the corresponding linear equations and solve for the unknowns. Without deriving those equations there is no easy other way to input the circuit and analyze it. Our project focuses on a very easy and user friendly input system of dependent source free linear circuits and analyses of it for DC, AC sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal sources. To be specific, it will solve for the node voltages, sweep the values of different elements to see how different circuit parameters change with it, show the voltage waveform and plot the magnitude spectrum in case of non-sinusoidal source. The limitation here is that the circuits cannot have dependent source in it. We have built an input system through which anyone can input the circuit by merely watching it and do some special tasks mentioned above. To facilitate the system we have used the GUI and dialogue box functions of MATLAB
